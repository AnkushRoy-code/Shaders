# Shaders

All my [ShadetToy](shadertoy.com) shaders will be here, Just click on the links to got to the actual updated code. Don't count on me to update the code to the latest version.

- [Multiple Function Plot](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/Shaders/edit/main/README.md) - Me getting my feet wet, getting to know the lands fo shaders. This is my first shader.
- [Morph Functions](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wf2Bz3) - Morphs 2 functions so that I can use that in my next project.
- [Morphlot](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WcjBWD) - This is something of an animation. Shows Morphing b/w several functions.

That is all there is to it. I am currently learning to do Raymarching. Probably come up with somethign cool there. TYSM for checking this repo out!
